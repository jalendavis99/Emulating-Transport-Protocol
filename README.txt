Reliable Protocol Emulation

This project aims to provide a reliable protocol emulation, allowing users to simulate and study the behavior of a reliable transport protocol in diverse network scenarios. By running the Assignmnt2.java file and providing runtime parameters, users can explore the performance and reliability of the protocol with large values for the number of messages to send.
